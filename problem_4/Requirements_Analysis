File storage: Will any hardware be needed for storage of data? 
What kind of sample size are we talking about? How many people and over what time period? Text only or are images, videos and other media also included?

Data:
What data fields are required? Eg. metrics of popularity, author username, or just text? Images, videos and other attachments needed?

Software:
Need access to Twitter/X and Facebook/Meta APIs. Is there a cost associated?
How will we filter for relevant posts? Keywords, tags, dates, location etc?
